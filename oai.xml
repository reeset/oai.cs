            This class represents the first OAI harvester, to my knowledge, written
            in C#, designed specifically to work within Microsoft's .NET or MONO's .NET
            frameworks.  The class was inspired by Ed Summer's OAI::Harvester module for
            PERL.

             Initial Release

             Change the way that the Web Request is made.  Many thanks to Lucien van Wouw
             for letting me know that DSpace IRs require that the web request include
             a user-agent.  No other OAI repository made this requirement -- but to keep
             problems from arising, I've modified the code so that a user-agent is 
             passed.  The default user-agent is now: "OSU .NET OAI Harvester" -- however
             this is stored as a constant that you may feel free to change.

             Modified ListRecords, ListSets and ListMetadataFormat so that the harvester
             will work with OAI repositories that export data in a single line.  
             Apparently the xmltextreader would read beyond the node if there wasn't 
             white space.  This has been corrected.  To make sure that I account for 
             this later, I've added an example to the example program.
             Also -- added a count property to the ListRecord class so that its
             easier to enumerate.

             Changes by Frank McCown - Old Dominion University
             1) Allowed access to request URL when accessing OAI repository.
             2) Allowed access to raw XML response.
             3) Fixed access with resumption token in ListRecords().
             4) Added new ListRecords constructor.
             5) Made DC metadata extraction more robust.
             6) Spead up XML parsing in some contexts.
             =============================================================================
             
             ===============================================================================
             October November 4, 2005
             Updated the resumptionToken tag.  It wasn't escaping the necessary characters.
             This is an issue that shows up in how NSF structures their resumption tokens.
